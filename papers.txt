    - types of boundary conditions discussed
    - "Many stable pairs of finite element spaces {Hh, Lh} have been proposed in the literature 
    - (see, e.g., Girault/Raviart [29], Hughes et al. [49] and [77])."
    - "We note that, from the point of view of accuracy, in our
    - context quadrilateral (hexahedral) elements are to be preferred over 
      triangular (tetrahedral) elements because of their superior approximation properties"
    - "Nonconforming “rotated” d-linear ˜Q1/P0 Stokes element"
    - good with inf/sup
        - "It possesses a “divergence-free” nodal-basis, which allows the elimina-
        tion of the pressure from the problem resulting in a positive definite algebraic
        system for the velocity unknowns alone. The reduced algebraic system can be
        solved by specially adapted multigrid methods; see Turek"

FINITE ELEMENT METHODS FOR NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS

    - operator splitting
    - second part has compressible flow
    - "The boundary
       condition ( 1 .4) is of Dirichlet type; more complicated boundary conditions
       are described in, e.g. Glowinski (1984), Bristeau et al (1985, 1987), and
       Pironneau ( 1989)"
    - (about precondtioned CG) "The key idea (which is due to J. Cahouet) is to linearly
      combine two residuals, one active for IX/V» 1 (large Reynolds numbers),
      while the other is well suited to IX/V « 1"
    - "It is a well accepted fact that the main difficulty related to the space
       approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations, in the pressure-velocity
       formulation, is the treatment of the incompressibility condition V' u = O."
    - "Indeed a finite element method for thc Stokes problem
       introduced in Bercovier & Pironneau (1979) was (implicitly) based on this
       idea. In the above reference one proves the convergence of a finite element
       approximation of the Stokes problem (4.1)-(4.3) (with 0: = 0 and r 0 = r),
       where one uses a continuous piecewise linear pressure on a triangulation
       :Yh/2' twice finer than :T,,; this finite element approximation will be described
       in the following Section 4.3.2"
    - generate initial mesh, then split each triangle for the velocity:
        - join the midpoints, or
        - join the vertices with the center
    - pressure multigrid

Implementation of Finite Element Methods for Navier-Stokes Equations
    - u h: "P2 + bubble" Triangle (or Modified P2); Ph: Discontinuous P1
        - bubble is third degree poly (composed of barycentric coords) with a single tuning parameter
        - h^2 velocity and pressure accuracy
        - the nodes for the pressure can be chosen anywhere on the triangle
    - u h : Q2 Quadrangle 57;Ph: Ql Discontinuous
        - same trick as above

Divergence-Free Mixed Finite Elements for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equation
https://d-nb.info/991225457/34
    - "The scheme is based on the Scott-Vogelius mixed finite element and on
       symmetric stabilization operators for dominant convection, proposed in the
       last recent years"
    - multigrid
    - "a new discretization scheme for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation at low and
       moderate Reynolds numbers is proposed and analyzed in this dissertation.
       The scheme is a LBB-stable conforming mixed finite element method, which
       is based on the Scott-Vogelius element pair [102], which uses continuous La-
       grangian elements for the discrete velocities and discontinuous Lagrangian
       elements for the pressure"
    - "Here, the approximation order of the velocities is
       one order higher than the approximation order of the pressure. Due to this
       special construction the velocity divergence operator is a mapping into the
       discrete pressure space. This enforces that discrete Navier-Stokes solutions
       are divergence-free pointwise [25]"
    - Scott-Vogelius = P_k / P_{k-1}, k >= 1
    - "The Pk-P−k+1 element for k ≥ 4 is LBB stable in 2D on quite general
       meshes that do not possess “singular vertices” [118, 117, 101, 102].
       We will explain this term below. But for k ≥ 4 and not smaller the
       Scott-Vogelius element is reduced stable on any mesh [123]"


The Scott-Vogelius finite elements revisited
https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00020
     - "We prove that the Scott-Vogelius finite elements are inf-sup stable on shape-regular meshes for piecewise quartic velocity fields and higher (k≥4)."
     - "One key aspect in the new proof is to use the stability of the P 2 −P 0
        (or the Bernardi-Raugel [2]) finite element spaces"

A new finite element formulation for computational fluid dynamics: V. Circumventing the babuška-brezzi condition: a stable Petrov-Galerkin formulation of the stokes problem accommodating equal-order interpolations
https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/0045-7825(86)90025-3
    - equal order of pressure and velocity
    - discontinuous
    - "REMARK 2.1. The equations of Stokes flow are form-identical to the equations of classical
      isotropic infinitesimal elasticity theory. Only the physical interpretation changes. In elasticity,
      u is the displacement vector and ,U is the shear modulus."
    - pressure stabilization. If stab terms are zero, the formulation is the same as the standard Galerkin one
    - "REMARK 3.1. (1) The purpose of the n-term is to improve upon the stability of the Galerkin
      formulation without compromising consistency. That consistency has been maintained is
      suggested by the fact that the u-modified method is a residual method, that is, if uh and ph are
      replaced by their exact counterparts, then (15) is satisfied as can be immediately seen from
      (22)"

Simple Nonconforming Quadrilateral Stokes Element
https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1002/num.1690080202
    - "While the convergence properties of the triangular nonconforming ele-
      ments are well studied in the literature (see, e.g., Ref. 5)"
    - "Unfortunately, on general nonuniform meshes the usual optimal order error
      estimates do not hold for if’b).This is due to the fact ;hat the spaces Hf/@are not “iso-
      parametric,” i.e., the multilinear tiansformations i,!JT: T -+ T are of another polynomial
      type than the shape functions on T."

Stabilized finite element schemes for incompressible flow using Scott–Vogelius elements
https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnum.2007.11.001
    - "In this paper we
      propose to use the lowest order Scott–Vogelius element [26,22,28] for the computation of incompressible flows. In
      two space dimensions this element corresponds to piecewise quadratic continuous interpolation for the velocities and
      piecewise affine discontinuous interpolation for the pressure"
