    - types of boundary conditions discussed
    - "Many stable pairs of finite element spaces {Hh, Lh} have been proposed in the literature 
    - (see, e.g., Girault/Raviart [29], Hughes et al. [49] and [77])."
    - "We note that, from the point of view of accuracy, in our
    - context quadrilateral (hexahedral) elements are to be preferred over 
      triangular (tetrahedral) elements because of their superior approximation properties"
    - "Nonconforming “rotated” d-linear ˜Q1/P0 Stokes element"
    - good with inf/sup
        - "It possesses a “divergence-free” nodal-basis, which allows the elimina-
        tion of the pressure from the problem resulting in a positive definite algebraic
        system for the velocity unknowns alone. The reduced algebraic system can be
        solved by specially adapted multigrid methods; see Turek"
    - "conforming d-linear Q1/Q1 Stokes element with pressure stabilization"
    - "In order to get a stable discretization, it was proposed by Hughes et al. [49],
       to add certain least squares terms in the continuity equation"

FINITE ELEMENT METHODS FOR NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS

    - operator splitting
    - second part has compressible flow
    - "The boundary
       condition ( 1 .4) is of Dirichlet type; more complicated boundary conditions
       are described in, e.g. Glowinski (1984), Bristeau et al (1985, 1987), and
       Pironneau ( 1989)"
    - (about precondtioned CG) "The key idea (which is due to J. Cahouet) is to linearly
      combine two residuals, one active for IX/V» 1 (large Reynolds numbers),
      while the other is well suited to IX/V « 1"
    - "It is a well accepted fact that the main difficulty related to the space
       approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations, in the pressure-velocity
       formulation, is the treatment of the incompressibility condition V' u = O."
    - "Indeed a finite element method for thc Stokes problem
       introduced in Bercovier & Pironneau (1979) was (implicitly) based on this
       idea. In the above reference one proves the convergence of a finite element
       approximation of the Stokes problem (4.1)-(4.3) (with 0: = 0 and r 0 = r),
       where one uses a continuous piecewise linear pressure on a triangulation
       :Yh/2' twice finer than :T,,; this finite element approximation will be described
       in the following Section 4.3.2"
    - generate initial mesh, then split each triangle for the velocity:
        - join the midpoints, or
        - join the vertices with the center
    - pressure multigrid

Implementation of Finite Element Methods for Navier-Stokes Equations
    - u h: "P2 + bubble" Triangle (or Modified P2); Ph: Discontinuous P1
        - bubble is third degree poly (composed of barycentric coords) with a single tuning parameter
        - h^2 velocity and pressure accuracy
        - the nodes for the pressure can be chosen anywhere on the triangle
    - u h : Q2 Quadrangle 57;Ph: Ql Discontinuous
        - same trick as above
    - 4xP1 / P1 also mentioned

Divergence-Free Mixed Finite Elements for the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equation
https://d-nb.info/991225457/34
    - "The scheme is based on the Scott-Vogelius mixed finite element and on
       symmetric stabilization operators for dominant convection, proposed in the
       last recent years"
    - multigrid
    - "a new discretization scheme for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation at low and
       moderate Reynolds numbers is proposed and analyzed in this dissertation.
       The scheme is a LBB-stable conforming mixed finite element method, which
       is based on the Scott-Vogelius element pair [102], which uses continuous La-
       grangian elements for the discrete velocities and discontinuous Lagrangian
       elements for the pressure"
    - "Here, the approximation order of the velocities is
       one order higher than the approximation order of the pressure. Due to this
       special construction the velocity divergence operator is a mapping into the
       discrete pressure space. This enforces that discrete Navier-Stokes solutions
       are divergence-free pointwise [25]"
    - Scott-Vogelius = P_k / P_{k-1}, k >= 1
    - "The Pk-P−k+1 element for k ≥ 4 is LBB stable in 2D on quite general
       meshes that do not possess “singular vertices” [118, 117, 101, 102].
       We will explain this term below. But for k ≥ 4 and not smaller the
       Scott-Vogelius element is reduced stable on any mesh [123]"


The Scott-Vogelius finite elements revisited
https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00020
     - "We prove that the Scott-Vogelius finite elements are inf-sup stable on shape-regular meshes for piecewise quartic velocity fields and higher (k≥4)."
     - "One key aspect in the new proof is to use the stability of the P 2 −P 0
        (or the Bernardi-Raugel [2]) finite element spaces"
